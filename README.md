# A cover allocation program aimed at streamlining the process of assigning teacher covers based on role hierarchy and availability. The system integrates a data store that categorizes teachers by their seniority and responsibilities, allowing department heads to efficiently determine how many covers each teacher should reasonably take. By automating role-based decision-making and prioritizing fairness, the program reduces administrative workload and improves transparency in cover distribution across the school.
